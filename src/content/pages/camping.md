When you book the Valley of the Cool Trees you get exclusive access to the whole site. That means you can make as much noise as you like, stay up as late as you like, and sleep as long as you like, knowing you won’t be disturbing anyone else and won’t be disturbed by anyone else.

Camping is a 1.5 acre wildflower meadow with stunning views of the valley. There’s plenty of space for lots of tent pitches, camper vans and caravans.

### Cooking facilities

We have two fully fitted and equipped kitchens - one outdoors under shelter and one indoors in a polytunnel - both large enough to cater for big groups. Facilities include, fridges, freezer, catering equipment, generous washing up stations, gas stoves.

### The Partytunnel

And just in case the weather is not fully compliant, the campsite also has a 50 foot polytunnel, which can be adapted to whatever use you want to make of it. We have speakers and a cinema projector if you want to have a party or a film night.

### Off-grid

The whole farm is completely off-grid, meaning we generate our own electricity from solar panels and filter water from our spring.
