We cater for groups of up to 50 people with facilities including indoor and outdoor kitchens, a 50 foot partytunnel, hot shower, compost toilets, fire pits, and hammocks.

Access is via stone and grass tracks, with parking available elsewhere if the field is too muddy for your vehicle.

Given our location, we are perfect for groups who value nature, privacy and freedom.

As well as space for tents and campervans/caravans, we also have some caravans that you are welcome to hire at a small additional cost. We also offer other services such as catering and fire tending should this be desired.

### The field

The campsite is a 1.5 acres wildflower meadow with stunning views of the valley. There’s plenty of space for tent pitches, as well as camper vans and caravans

### Compost toilets and urinals

There are two compost toilets in the field, one men’s and one women’s urinal

### Flower shower

Enjoy a hot shower whilst smelling the roses :)

### Cooking facilities

We have two fully fitted and equipped kitchens - one outdoors under shelter and one indoors - both large enough to cater for big groups. Facilities inlcude, fridges, freezer, catering equipment, generous washing up stations, four x gas stoves.

### The Partytunnel

And just in case the weather is not fully compliant, the campsite also has a 50 foot polytunnel, which can be adapted to whatever use you want to make of it. We also have ???W speakers and a cinema projector available for hire.

### Off-grid

The whole farm is completely off-grid, meaning we generate our own electricity (solar panels) and harvest and process our own water. For the campsite, we harvest rain water and run it through extensive filtering to ensure that when you come here you’re probably drinking the purest water you’ve ever had. (too much?)

### Additional offers

- Tours: We’d be more than happy to show you round the land, show you our favourite spots, what edible and medicinals are in season…
- Food: In the productive months, we will have home-grown organic (not certified) food for sale. We also have a fantastic farm shop nearby so can organise all your fresh produce (veg, meat, eggs etc) if you like. And if you would like us to cater your whole event, we can do so for a fee (call to discuss further).
- Super deluxe stay: we can provide additional services such as daily cleaning of kitchens and toilets, fire keeper etc etc
