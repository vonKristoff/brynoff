### Exclusive access

When you book the Valley of the Cool Trees you get exclusive access to the whole site. That means you can make as much noise as you like, stay up as late as you like, and sleep as long as you like, knowing you won’t be disturbing anyone else and won’t be disturbed by anyone else.


### Your own private wildflower meadow

Camping is in a 1.5 acre wildflower meadow with stunning views of the valley in the daytime and epic stargazing at night. There’s plenty of space for lots of tent pitches, camper vans and caravans.


### Cooking

We’ve got camp cooking covered:

Outdoor kitchen to help you make the most of sunny days.

Indoor kitchen so you can keep the food coming whatever the weather.

Fully equiped with fridges, freezer, gas stoves, catering gear, and the king of washing-up stations.

Campfire cooking - we can also provide equipment to cook on the campfire, whether it’s a full on barbecue or just toasted marshmallows.


### The Partytunnel

And just in case the weather is not fully compliant, the campsite also has a 50 foot polytunnel, which can be adapted to whatever use you want to make of it. We have games, speakers and a cinema projector to keep you entertained on those rainy days.


### Compost toilets 

We have five compost toilets in the field, including our legendary 'Poo with a View'.


### Flower shower

Wake up and smell the roses in our solar-powered flower shower.


### Off-grid

The whole farm is completely off-grid, meaning we generate our own electricity from solar panels and filter water from our spring.
